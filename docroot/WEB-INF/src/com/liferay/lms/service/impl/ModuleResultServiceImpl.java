 * The implementation of the module result remote service.

 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. Always use {@link com.liferay.lms.service.ModuleResultServiceUtil} to access the module result remote service.

 * This is a remote service. Methods of this service are expected to have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can be accessed remotely.
